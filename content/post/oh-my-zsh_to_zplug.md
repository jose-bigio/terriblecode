# What is zplug?

[zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) is plugin manager for zsh. 
If you've ever used [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) it's 
pretty much the same idea and it's made by the same guy. With it you can 
pull down various git repositories and use them as pluggable items into your
own zsh distribution.

zplug is nice because it's light, has an intuitive interface, and it's 
extremely fast. As a an everyday zsh user, zplug has shrunk my zshrc and 
heavily reduced the amount of headaches I have when it comes to how fast 
my prompt shows up.

# So how do you use it?

```console


```
