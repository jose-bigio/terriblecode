Hi! My name is Eli and I'm currently a software developer at 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/). I currently write a ton of shell scripts
and do a bunch of automation surrounding releasing [Docker CE](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce)

The main project that I work on right now is [sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) and
I'm currently running a few other personal projects like 
[nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) and
[retry.it](https://github.com/seemethere/retry.it).

I really like contributing to open source and managing open source projects as well 
as interacting with the open source communities.

If you need to contact me feel free to tweet at me [@_seemethere](https://twitter.com/_seemethere)!
