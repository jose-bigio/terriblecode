Hi! My name is Eli and I'm currently a software developer at 
[Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/). I'm a big fan of Python
and love learning about new technologies.

The main project that I work on right now is [sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) and
I'm currently running a few otherpersonal projects like 
[nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) and
[retry.it](https://github.com/seemethere/retry.it).

I really like contributing to open source and managing open source projects as well 
as interacting with the open source communities.

If you need to contact me feel free to tweet at me [@Eli_ilE](https://twitter.com/Eli_ilE)!
